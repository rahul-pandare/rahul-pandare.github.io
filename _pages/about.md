## Hi, I'm Rahul 💡🧑🏻‍💻🤿🏄🏻‍♂️  

## I am a Ph.D. student at [City College of New York, NY](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/engineering) 🎓, and I enjoy biking 🚴🏼, hiking 🗻, and scuba diving 🐠.

I work with [Prof. Jeffrey Morris](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/jeff-morris). My research focuses on the fascinating world of **dense suspensions**—complex fluids where microscopic interactions drive macroscopic behavior.

## 🔬 Research Interests  

### **🔹 Dense Suspensions & Contact Networks**  
I investigate the rheology and contact parameters of **non-Brownian bidisperse dense suspensions** using the [**LF-DEM**](https://github.com/ryseto/LF_DEM) (Lubricated Flow - Discrete Element Method) model. My work leverages **graph theory** and **non-equilibrium particle physics** to analyze microstructural properties that drive emergent behaviors in these systems like shear thickening and shear jamming with a focus on high bidisperse systems.

### **🔹 Particle Tracking & Machine Learning**  
During my Ph.D., I worked on a **clogging problem** with soft particles flowing through a hopper. I developed **image processing techniques** to detect particle centers and later built a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** to automate tracking, achieving a **50x speedup**. I combined **convolution techniques** with **χ² analysis** for faster, more accurate tracking.

### **🔹 DEM Simulations & Hobby Projects**  
Outside my core research, I build **Discrete Element Method (DEM)** simulations to test various hypotheses. I’ve explored **maximum packing fractions** of dense suspensions and am currently investigating how **particle rigidity** impacts packing fraction using the **Hertzian contact model**.

These projects allow me to push the boundaries of simulation techniques and explore fundamental questions in particulate matter physics.
