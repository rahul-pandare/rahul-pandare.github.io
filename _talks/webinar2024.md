Dense non-Brownian suspensions, found in industries like cement and chocolate, exhibit complex flow behavior influenced by shear and particle interactions. Using LF-DEM, we study 2D bidisperse systems, modeling polydispersity and jamming transitions. Employing the pebble game algorithm, we analyze rigidity percolation, particle contacts, and rheology to understand the formation of rigid clusters.
