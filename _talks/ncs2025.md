The onset of shear thickening and, ultimately, jamming occurs due to the formation of large-scale microstructures within the suspension. Although these events are rare, they are significant enough to counterbalance the imposed shear stress in dense suspensions, leading to the development of frictional contact networks that resist further deformation.
