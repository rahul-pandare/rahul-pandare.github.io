Discontinuous shear thickening (DST) in suspensions occurs when stress drives particles into frictional contact networks, setting a threshold for shear-induced contacts. Using an established simulation technique [1], we show that contact networks grow with solid fraction and fluctuate under flow. As jamming nears, rigid clusters emerge with 2D Ising-like critical behavior. We analyze scaling in mono- and bidisperse suspensions (up to a 4:1 size ratio) and examine how shear and normal stresses relate to rigid structure formation.
