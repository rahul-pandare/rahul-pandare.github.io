I often revisit the Navier-Stokes equation and find myself grappling with the same questions about its structure, underlying assumptions, and the linear algebra concepts I've forgotten over time. This summary report provides a clear explanation of the equation's structure while also serving as a refresher on essential linear algebra and vector calculus concepts.
