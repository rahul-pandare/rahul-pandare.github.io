In this paper, we analyze the contact network of highly bidisperse (4:1 size ratio) dense suspensions. We observe a remarkable difference in the nature of pair-wise interactions between particles compared to the lower bidisperse case. We also investigate the jamming tendencies and how the system approaches jamming.
